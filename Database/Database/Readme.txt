################   ACRIMA Database    ################

ACRIMA database is composed by 705 fundus images (396 glaucomatous and 309 normal images). They were collected at the FISABIO Oftalmología Médica in Valencia, Spain, from glaucomatous and normal patients with their previous consent and in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. All images from ACRIMA database were annotated by glaucoma experts with several years of experience. They were cropped around the optic disc and renamed. 

The image name has the following structure: First, the name starts with the two letters "Im", followed by an image number composed by three digits (starting from 001 until 705), followed by the label (this label is "_g_" if the image is pathological and "_" if the image is normal). Finally, all image names have the database name, "ACRIMA", at the end of their names. For example, a name for a glaucomatous image is "Im686_g_ACRIMA" and "Im001_ACRIMA" for a normal image.
